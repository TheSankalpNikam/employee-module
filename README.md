# Employee Module
->Internship Project

On an ongoing, I created a separate module called as 'Employee' using,
- HTML, CSS, JS for front-end
- Java V1.8 for back-end and (J2EE) server-side validation
- Struts V1 as a Framework
- MySQL V5 as a database

Working of the module:-
- Will list all the employees
- We can update and delete the records
- We can add new employees to the list
- added features like checkbox, dropdown box, file upload, text-editor to add the employee description.

Added validations using JavaScript.
