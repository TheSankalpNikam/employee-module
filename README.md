# Employee Module
->Internship Project

On an ongoing, I created a separate module called as 'Employee' using,
- HTML, CSS, JS for front-end
- Java V1.8 for back-end and (J2EE) server-side validation
- Struts V1 as a Framework
- MySQL V5 as a database

Working of the module:-
- Will list all the employees
- We can update and delete the records
- We can add new employees to the list
- added features like checkbox, dropdown box, file upload, text-editor to add the employee description.

Added validations using JavaScript.

Employee module fields are as follows,
- Employee id (Auto-generated)
- First name (Validation only alphabets)
- Last name (Validation only alphabets)
- Email id (Validation proper mail id including alphabets, numbers, '@' symbol, '.com' at the end)
- Mobile no (only 10 digits)
- Gender (Checkbox)
- Country (Dropdown list along with 'AutoFill' feature as well)
- City (Dropdown list along with 'AutoFill' feature as well and city will be displayed based on the country selected)
- Description regarding the employee (Text-editor where employee can write, style and edit text)
- File uploaded by the employee (File upload feature like resume, image or documents)

This is just sub-module of the bigger picture.
